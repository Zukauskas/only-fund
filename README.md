## About

Trying to move my react project (which repo is hidden at the moment) to Next.js. 

### Things that are done
- [x] Moved all existing code to next js and made sure it is working
- [x] Create pages for homepage, new project, admin dasboard, login, register and move content there

### Things to do/ideas to work on
- [ ] Improve registation
- [ ] Create a proper authentication (with Next-auth)
- [ ] Make use of SSR for some pages (need to research)
- [ ] Style everything (with Tailwindcss)
